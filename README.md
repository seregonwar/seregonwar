# Hi, it's Seregon! ðŸ‘‹
I am a huge computer science enthusiast currently pursuing my degree in computer engineering at La Sapienza University.

## Passions
I am an active member of the Sony console modding community. If I touched an Xbox, I would probably brick it! ðŸ˜… If you browse through my repositories, youâ€™ll definitely find something related to console modding.

**P.S.** Iâ€™ve developed a payload injector and an unpacker that Iâ€™m very proud of, which allows the decryption and unpacking of `.PUP` update files for PlayStation 3/4. The project is currently down due to a few issues, but I plan to revive it and make it compatible with `.PUP` files for PlayStation 5 as well.
